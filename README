Gesture - a system level gesture listener for linux

INTRODUCTION

  Gesture is a touch input listener for linux systems. It detects configurable
  gestures on the touch device and sends the associated keypresses. This
  occurs at the system level using event streams, so it works anywhere, even
  in a terminal with no display server. As a result, it is relatively
  portable, as it works on any linux system with a touch device.

  Gesture is designed to enable power users to run a minimal interface on
  their devices, either with no GUI, or with a mostly keyboard driven
  GUI. This can be done all without a keyboard. However, it will also work
  (albeit with little use) on a laptop touch pad.

COPYING

COMPILE

  make all

USAGE

    ./gesture
	<type configuration into stdin>

  Root may be required to access the system level event streams. By default,
  a press that does not leave the center region indicates that the next
  press should be ignored and act as a regular mouse action.

  Note: At the moment, usage inside an X server (I haven't tested any other
  display servers yet) does not work because X steals all input events,
  preventing Gesture from reading them. However, it will work in a terminal
  (usually accessed with ctrl-alt-f#).

CONFIGURATION

  Config data is passed to gesture through the standard input. A default
  configuration file is included (see ./config), and it can be used through
  redirection ('<'). You can use config files in this manner, or simply type
  the settings in each time you run it.

  The first line is the path to the event stream to listen to. This usually
  takes the form of "/dev/input/event#". You can determine which event stream
  to use by checking each one with cat while touching the input device.

  The remaining lines each consist of two sequences separated by a space, but
  with no spaces inside each one. The first is the sequence of regions in the
  gesture. This will always start with 0, because each gesture must start at
  the center. Each remaining number is the identifier for the region: 1 for up,
  2 for right, 3 for down, and 4 for left. The second sequence is the list of
  keypresses to make whenever the specified gesture is performed. Each
  character may be any letter, number, or symbol that appears when a key is
  pressed (such as a, b, and c, but not A, B, and C). Additionally, special
  keys may be used enclosed in <>, such as <space>, <enter>, and <shift>.
